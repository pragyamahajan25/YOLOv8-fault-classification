# üß† Fault Pattern Recognition & Image-Based Fault Intensity Classification Using Deep Learning

This project investigates how **image faults (blur)** affect **object detection confidence** in YOLOv8 and develops a **deep learning model** to classify **fault intensity**.

It was completed as part of the *Studienarbeit* at the **University of Siegen (Chair of Zuverl√§ssigkeit Technischer Systeme & Elektrische Messtechnik)**.

## üìò Overview

Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on camera-based perception. Environmental effects such as **blur**, **fog**, or **rain** can degrade image quality and reduce the reliability of detection models.  
This project focuses on **blur faults** to study:

1. How YOLOv8 detection confidence changes with increasing blur.  
2. How a CNN (ResNet-18) can automatically classify the **intensity** of such image faults.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 1 ‚Äî YOLOv8 Fault Analysis

Phase 1 analyzes YOLOv8‚Äôs behavior on **fault-injected images** to reveal confidence degradation and model sensitivity.

### üß∞ Fault Injection Process
To simulate realistic sensor faults, a **Python-based Fault-Injection Tool** was used:  
‚û°Ô∏è **GitHub:** [thomas-de-fosse/faults-injecting-tool](https://github.com/thomas-de-fosse/faults-injecting-tool)

- The tool applies **Gaussian blur** with different kernel sizes to generate three blur intensities:
  - `blur_low`
  - `blur_medium`
  - `blur_extreme`
- Each clean image was duplicated across these categories plus the original (`no_fault`), producing **39,972 images** in total.

Example (from the report):

| Fault Level | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| No Fault | Clear image |
| Low Blur | Slightly blurred edges |
| Medium Blur | Visible distortion |
| Extreme Blur | Loss of fine detail |

### üß© Object Detection Pipeline

* **Model:** [YOLOv8n](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (Nano variant ‚Äì lightweight & real-time)
* **Framework:** PyTorch (via Ultralytics API)
* **Pre-trained Weights:** COCO dataset (80 classes)

Each image category (`no_fault`, `blur_low`, `blur_medium`, `blur_extreme`) was processed with YOLOv8n.
For each image, detection results (class + confidence) were saved to JSON and Excel for analysis.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

results = model("data/blur_low/cat_001.jpg")
results.save("outputs/blur_low/")
```

### üìä Post-Processing and Pattern Recognition

Detection confidences for the **target class ‚Äúcat‚Äù** were extracted and compared across fault levels.
Images were grouped into **7 behavioral cases**, e.g.:

* **Case 1:** No detection after minimal blur (high fault sensitivity)
* **Case 2:** Gradual, expected confidence drop (robust behavior)
* **Case 3:** Confidence increases under blur (anomalous behavior)
* *(Cases 4‚Äì7 cover other intermediate or reversed trends)*

These cases expose how lightweight YOLO models may over- or under-react to degraded visuals, affecting safety in real-world applications.

## üîç Phase 2 ‚Äî Fault Intensity Classification

Phase 2 develops a CNN to **quantify fault intensity** based on image appearance.

### üß† Model

* **Backbone:** ResNet-18 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
* **Output Classes:** No Fault | Low | Medium | Extreme
* **Loss:** CrossEntropy
* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Scheduler:** StepLR (Œ≥ = 0.1 per 7 epochs)

```python
from torchvision import models
import torch.nn as nn

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 4)
```

Training was executed on the **Omni GPU Cluster** (University of Siegen).
The dataset was split 80 % train / 10 % val / 10 % test.

## üßæ Dataset

Dataset used in this study:
üì¶ **Kaggle ‚Äì Cat Dataset (9,993 images)**
‚û°Ô∏è [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-dataset)

Each image was duplicated with injected blur levels ‚Üí total **‚âà 39 k images** across four classes.
